##Codebook
The tidy dataset generated by the run_analysis.R script consists of the 68 variables listed below.  The first variable is the activity during which the reading was taken and the second is the subject #.  For each activity and subject, the other 66 variables provide average mean or standard deviation estimated from the raw signal data. Acceleration variables are in standard gravity units 'g.' Angular velocity variables are in radians/second.  All variables come from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones; both the train and test datasets are used.
